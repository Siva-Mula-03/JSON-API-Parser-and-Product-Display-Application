# JSON API Parser and Product Display Application
link:[https://sivamula99-json-api-parser-and-product-display-application.vercel.app/]
## Objective

Develop an application that fetches JSON data from a given API endpoint and parses it to extract product information. The application should then present this data in a structured manner, prioritizing the display of products based on their popularity.

## JSON API Details

The API to be parsed is located at:
[https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-to-cors/assignment.json](https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-to-cors/assignment.json)

The JSON data contains 1000 records of products, each having the following attributes:
- Subcategory
- Title
- Price
- Popularity

## Requirements

### 1. Data Parsing and Storage:
- Implement a mechanism to programmatically fetch the JSON data from the provided API.
- Store the fetched data in a suitable data structure of your choice within the application.

### 2. Data Presentation:
- Display the parsed product data in a user-friendly presentation.
- Ensure that the products are ordered based on descending popularity, meaning the most popular products should be displayed first.



## Instructions to Run Locally 

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [Your Repository URL]

# Navigate to the project directory
cd [Your Project Directory]

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the application
npm start


```

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
